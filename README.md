## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a comprehensive predictive model to enhance customer conversion rates within the US Personal Auto Insurance sector. By leveraging historical, behavioral, and external data, the model identifies key factors influencing customer decisions and predicts the likelihood of conversion. The project demonstrates expertise in data manipulation, hypothesis testing, model building, and visualization, aligning closely with industry practices in demand and decision science.
